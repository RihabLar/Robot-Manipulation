Robot Manipulation Projects
A collection of industrial robot manipulation projects completed during the IFROS master's program, demonstrating practical applications in automated classification, assembly, and surface processing tasks.

ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This repository contains three hands-on robotics projects focusing on pick-and-place operations and surface manipulation using industrial robots programmed in VAL3 and URScript.

ðŸ¤– Project 1: Automated Cylinder Classification System
Robot: StÃ¤ubli TS60
Duration: December 2024
Description
Developed an automated classification system that sorts metallic and non-metallic cylinders using real-time sensor data and places them in a classification matrix.
Key Achievements

Programmed a 3-level classification system progressing from manual to fully automated operation
Integrated inductive sensors for real-time material detection (metallic vs. non-metallic)
Implemented continuous feeding mechanism with 4-cylinder capacity per operation
Designed dynamic routing protocols (OSPF, BGP, EIGRP) for multi-branch network communication
Controlled actuators, barriers, and trolley systems for synchronized material flow

Technical Skills

Languages: VAL3
Tools: EVE-NG, Cisco Packet Tracer, StÃ¤ubli Robotics Suite
Concepts: Pick-and-place automation, sensor integration, I/O mapping, trajectory planning

Results
Successfully classified and placed 4 metallic and 4 non-metallic cylinders with 100% accuracy using automated sensor-driven sorting.

ðŸ”§ Project 2: Cylinder-Piston Assembly System
Robots: StÃ¤ubli TX60
Duration: December 2024
Description
Implemented a complete assembly line that picks cylinders and pistons from dispensers, assembles them at an assembly station, and places finished products in a matrix.
Key Achievements

Developed 3-level assembly program from basic to sensor-integrated continuous operation
Integrated presence sensors for piston detection across 8 random positions
Programmed dual-tool coordination (lateral tool for cylinders, tip tool for pistons)
Created custom reference frames for precise matrix placement
Implemented safety protocols with dual-speed control (normal and cautious velocities)

Technical Skills

Languages: VAL3, URScript
Platforms: StÃ¤ubli Robotics Suite, PolyScope
Concepts: Multi-tool operations, reference frames, digital I/O control, teach pendant programming

Results
Successfully assembled 4 cylinder-piston units with automatic piston detection and precise matrix placement across 12 positions (4 rows Ã— 3 columns).

ðŸ”¨ Project 3: Irregular Surface Polishing
Robot: UR3e Collaborative Robot
Duration: December 2024
Description
Programmed a collaborative robot to polish an irregular surface following a zig-zag trajectory while maintaining constant contact force.
Key Achievements

Achieved consistent force application across irregular surface topography
Programmed 10-waypoint zig-zag trajectory for complete surface coverage
Configured tool orientation to remain normal to polishing surface
Implemented real-time position tracking for debugging and performance monitoring
Applied collaborative robot safety standards for human-robot interaction

Technical Skills

Languages: URScript
Platform: PolyScope (UR3e interface)
Concepts: Force control, trajectory planning, waypoint programming, tool configuration

Results
Successfully polished entire irregular surface with consistent force application and smooth transitions between waypoints, demonstrated in video documentation.
