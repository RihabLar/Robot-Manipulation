## Project 1: Automated Cylinder Classification
**Robot**: Stäubli TS60 | **Language**: VAL3

Developed an automated system to classify cylinders as metallic or non-metallic using inductive sensors. The robot picks cylinders from a dispenser, classifies them in real-time, and places them in a 4×3 matrix. Implemented continuous feeding system handling 4 metallic and 4 non-metallic cylinders per cycle.

## Project 2: Cylinder-Piston Assembly
**Robot**: Stäubli TX60 | **Language**: VAL3

Programmed the robot to pick cylinders and pistons from separate dispensers, assemble them at an assembly station, and place completed units in a matrix. Used presence sensors to detect pistons at 8 random positions. Coordinated two tools: lateral gripper for cylinders and tip gripper for pistons.

## Project 3: Surface Polishing
**Robot**: UR3e Collaborative Robot | **Language**: URScript

Programmed the robot to polish an irregular surface using force control. Defined 10 waypoints in a zig-zag trajectory, configured tool orientation normal to the surface, and maintained constant polishing force throughout the operation.
